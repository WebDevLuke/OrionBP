# Building style guides with kss-node

This software is a Node.js implementation of [Knyle Style Sheets](https://github.com/kneath/kss) (KSS), "a documentation syntax for CSS" that's intended to have syntax readable by humans *and* machines. Hence, the kss-node software can be used to create a "living style guide".

1. Write human-readable documentation using "KSS syntax" comments. Can be added to CSS, Sass, LESS, or any other CSS Preprocessor files.
2. Have the `kss` tool automatically build a style guide from your stylesheets.
